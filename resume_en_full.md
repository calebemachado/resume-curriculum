## Summary
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with nearly 10 years of experience designing and building scalable web systems for high-impact companies in Brazil and the United States. My core expertise includes backend development with Java, Kotlin, and Node.js, and infrastructure design using tools like Spring Boot, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to mission-critical projects at companies such as PayPal, iFood, and Adaptive Insurance, leading efforts in microservices architecture, authentication flows (MFA), and cloud resource optimization. I also played key roles in digital transformation initiatives for government agencies in Brazil, such as CVM, MP-GO, and SEFAZ-MT.

I’m passionate about clean code, domain-driven design, and building distributed systems that solve real-world problems. I'm currently collaborating remotely with a US-based insurance company and exploring pathways to contribute directly from the United States. Open to connections and conversations related to software architecture, cloud solutions, and global tech innovation.
